## Results

Answer the following question: 

* **Question:** What is the best value for `k`?

* **Answer:** Based on the data gathered, the best value for k would be 4.

Using the scaled data also showed cluster overlapping one another, which could lead to a misinterpretation and named a poor fit.

Answer the following questions: 

* **Question:** What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

* **Answer:** Based on the PCA data, the optimal value for 'k' is still 4.


* **Question:** Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

* **Answer:** The value of 'k' does not differ from the original data.
